# Sprint: {epic_title}

<!--
  Generated by execution-plan-generator skill
  Repo: {repo}
  Epic: #{epic_number}
  Generated: {timestamp}
  
  This plan is compatible with the sprint-runner skill format.
  Each issue section contains enough context for autonomous execution.
-->

## Config
- **repo:** {org}/{repo_name}
- **base-branch:** {base_branch}
- **wip-limit:** {wip_limit}
- **total-issues:** {total_issues}
- **estimated-phases:** {phase_count}

## Dependency Graph

<!--
  Format: #N (no deps) — root issues with no prerequisites
          #M → depends on #N — M cannot start until N is complete
          #M → depends on #N, #P — M depends on multiple issues
  
  Confidence markers (optional):
    [explicit]  — dependency stated in issue body
    [semantic]  — inferred from type layering (schema before consumer)
    [overlap]   — inferred from file overlap analysis
    [keyword]   — inferred from cross-reference of concepts
-->

- #{root_issue} (no deps)
- #{dependent_issue} → depends on #{root_issue} [{confidence}]

## Phases

<!--
  Phases group issues by execution order.
  All issues in a phase can start once their specific deps are met.
  Phase boundaries are recommendations, not hard gates — 
  an issue can start as soon as its own deps complete.
-->

### Phase 0 — Foundation
<!-- Schemas, contracts, interfaces, security primitives -->
<!-- These have no dependencies and should start immediately -->
- #{issue}: {title}

### Phase 1 — Core
<!-- Core implementation consuming Phase 0 outputs -->
- #{issue}: {title}

### Phase 2 — Integration
<!-- Adapters, connectors, loaders that wire core to externals -->
- #{issue}: {title}

### Phase 3 — Quality
<!-- Tests, e2e, benchmarks, validation -->
- #{issue}: {title}

### Phase 4 — Adoption
<!-- Docs, migration guides, CI/CD, rollout -->
- #{issue}: {title}

## Lanes

<!--
  Lanes are parallel execution tracks. Issues within a lane are sequential.
  Issues in different lanes can run concurrently (up to WIP limit).
  
  Format: Lane {letter} ({theme}): #{first} → #{second} → #{third}
  
  Theme is the dominant classification of issues in the lane.
  The arrow (→) indicates execution order within the lane.
-->

Lane A ({theme_a}): #{a1} → #{a2} → #{a3}
Lane B ({theme_b}): #{b1} → #{b2}
Lane C ({theme_c}): #{c1} → #{c2} → #{c3}

## WIP Recommendation

<!--
  WIP (Work In Progress) limit = max concurrent issues being worked on.
  Based on: issue count, lane count, file overlap density, team size.
-->

- **Recommended WIP:** {wip_limit}
- **Rationale:** {wip_rationale}
- **Lane count:** {lane_count}
- **Overlap density:** {overlap_density} (low/medium/high)

## Issues

<!--
  Each issue section contains everything needed for autonomous execution.
  The sprint-runner skill reads these sections to create branches and PRs.
  
  Fields:
    Files      — packages/files likely touched (from analysis or issue body)
    Phase      — which phase this belongs to (for ordering)
    Depends on — explicit upstream issues (empty = root issue)
    Acceptance criteria — from issue body, or synthesized from requirements
    Dev prompt — contextual instructions for the implementing agent
                 Includes: what to build, which interfaces to consume,
                 testing expectations, and any gotchas
-->

### #{number}: {title}
- **Files:** `{path1}`, `{path2}`
- **Phase:** {phase_number}
- **Depends on:** #{dep1}, #{dep2} (or "none")
- **Labels:** {label1}, {label2}
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] {criterion_1}
  - [ ] {criterion_2}
  - [ ] {criterion_3}
- **Dev prompt:**
  > {contextual_instructions}
  >
  > **Key interfaces:** {interfaces_to_consume_or_produce}
  > **Testing:** {testing_expectations}
  > **Watch out:** {gotchas_or_warnings}

---

<!--
  Repeat ### #{number}: {title} block for each issue.
  Order issues by phase, then by lane, then by dependency depth.
-->

## Notes

<!--
  Optional section for:
  - Warnings about detected cycles (and how they were broken)
  - Issues with empty bodies that need clarification
  - Cross-repo dependencies
  - Suggestions for splitting large issues
  - Codebase observations relevant to the sprint
